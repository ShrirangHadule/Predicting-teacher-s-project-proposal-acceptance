# Predicting-teacher-s-project-proposal-acceptance
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of proposals each year for classroom projects that need funding. Many volunteers are required to screen each submission before it's approved manually. The goal is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions and additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school.
